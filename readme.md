# Docker-PHP7-MariaDB

Forked from https://github.com/shameerc/docker-php7

A boilerplate for a future Laravel project. This is made specific for local development.

# Why
⋅⋅* OS X El Capitan comes with php 5. Newest Laravel need php 7
⋅⋅* There is no need (at least for me) to install/setup Homestead(or Vagrant)

# How to use
⋅⋅* `git clone https://github.com/thiodordelis/Laravel-blog-Docker-setup.git`
⋅⋅* `cd Laravel-blog-Docker-setup`
⋅⋅* `docker-compose up`
⋅⋅* `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer/composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog` This will install laravel using an alternative method.
⋅⋅* `cd blog`
⋅⋅* Rename Laravel's `.env.example` to `.env`
⋅⋅* Configure `DB_*` settings inside `.env`
⋅⋅* `docker exec <CONTAINER_ID> php artisan key:generate`
⋅⋅* Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

# What is included
⋅⋅* Latest nginx, MariaDB, php 7.1, Laravel 5.5
